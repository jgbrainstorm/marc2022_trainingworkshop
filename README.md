# MARC2022 Training Workshop on Machine Learning and NLP

### Introduction

Digital learning and assessment generate a large amount of data in various forms. To deal with the complex data,
psychometric researchers need to garner new techniques from data science, machine learning, and natural
language processing (NLP). To facilitate the learning, an edited volume, Computational Psychometrics (Eds. von
Davier, Mislevy, & Hao, 2022), was developed to introduce the new techniques in a way more accessible to
researchers with psychometrics backgrounds. ML and NLP are two very extensive research disciplines
themselves, and it is impossible to cover them fully in such a short workshop. As such, this workshop aims to
provide the participants with a high-level overview of ML and NLP as well as some practical knowledge of using
them in the context of educational assessment. We hope the workshop can help participants to get started with the
acquisition of these important skills.
